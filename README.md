# spotify-clone

This Spotify Clone uses Next.js. Next.js is a framework that makes it easy to create 'universal' React apps - React apps that do both client and server side rendering.

# Running locally in development mode

To get started, just clone the repository and run `npm install && npm run dev`:

    git clone https://github.com/iaincollins/nextjs-starter.git
    npm install
    npm run dev
    
    
## Configuring

If you configure a .env file (just copy [.env.example](https://github.com/iaincollins/nextjs-starter/blob/master/.env.example) over to '.env' and fill in the options) you can configure a range of options.

See the [AUTHENTICATION.md](https://github.com/iaincollins/nextjs-starter/blob/master/AUTHENTICATION.md) for how to set up oAuth if you want to do that. It suggested you start with Twitter as it's the easiest to get working.
